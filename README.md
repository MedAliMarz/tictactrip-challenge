Deployed : https://tictactrip-challenge.herokuapp.com/

## Description

I worked on the challenge 1h30/day for about 4 days.     
I started by solving the justify challenged using python then transcode it into JS.    
I used  'jsonwebtoken' npm module for jwt based authentication.    
For rate limiting i implemented the Token Bucket algo, where token === words number


ps : Because of the challenge context, I opted to used in memory storage to facilitate development
